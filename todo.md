# MKEditor Typescript rewrite

Left to do:

- Re-implement save markdown and export to HTML from browser context.
- Sort folder structure for electron-builder to build the installer.
- Add a "cancel" button to the save prompt dialog to make it clearer that the user can exit the dialog and carry on wat they were doing.
