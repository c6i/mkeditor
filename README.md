### Development

1. Install the dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

2. Build the application

```sh
npm run build
```

3. Create the application installer

```sh
npm run make:installer
```

This will create a new folder named `windows-installer` in the `out/` directory.

You can now open `mkeditor-setup-x64.exe` to run the installer and install MKEditor.
